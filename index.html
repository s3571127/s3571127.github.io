							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<p>Hi there! My name is Oscar Bridgford, and I am currently enrolled as a student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). I am in my last semester of my Bachelor of Business degree, which consists of a major in Marketing. I was born in Auckland, New Zealand, as were both of my parents, but however have lived in Melbourne, Australia for the majority of my life. I am 22 years old, and will be 23 on the 29th of December. I completed my Victorian Certificate of Education in 2013 at St Kevin’s College, Toorak. I have worked various roles in the hospitality industry including bartending, waiting and catering, and am in the process of starting as a Sales Manager at a domestic tourism wholesaler. </p>

							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>I have had a very keen interest in some areas of IT for the majority of my life. I have been interested in gaming systems and games since a very young age, mostly in the First Person Shooter (FPS) and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genres. As I got older, I also learned to appreciate how prevalent IT is within our everyday lives, which gave me a better understanding of its importance and impact in the world around us. As a First World country, we are almost guaranteed to encounter or interact with some form of IT system throughout our day, which only strengthened my interest. I have the technological experience of the average millennial Australian, where I am tech savvy with devices such as my smartphone and laptop, however I wish to learn skills and knowledge that will put me at an advantage in my professional career and life in general. </p>
							<p>I chose to come to RMIT mostly due to a wide variety of friends who are in enrolled in various different courses given by the university. It was mostly their praise and good reviews that led to me to study here. This was further strengthened by the style of teachings, and the newness of the business building, Building 80. What ultimately made my decision for me though was that RMIT allowed me to enter my Bachelor degree through completion of the Certificate IV, Diploma and Advanced Diploma of the same course, which then also gave advanced standing and university credit points towards my degree. This meant that I did not have to start my Bachelors completely and relearn previously taught content. </p>
							<p>From this specific course, I expect to learn a basic knowledge of the broad topics within the Information Technology field. I expect to gain knowledge on key topics and components to IT that I knew were present but know nothing about, such as Security, the Internet and how these work. I also expect to gain knowledge on topics that are completely new to me, and are vital to how IT works but work behind the scenes and go unnoticed to the untrained eye. I expect to gain knowledge on particular topics that interest me such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and how security breaches happen and are managed. </p>

							<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
							<ul class="actions stacked">
							<li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=b0f67ee3d80f84a0&tk=1ckmvfv9ibs0lbe6&from=serp&vjs=3" class="button">Find Out About My Ideal Job Here</a></li>
							</ul>
							<p>My ideal job outcome would be a Marketing Communications Manager within a popular music festival, or within a music events company. The advertisement I have selected is for Eventbrite. Eventbrite is a company that allows for clients and music venues to sell tickets to events easily. I would focus on the communications and marketing for music venues and promoters towards consumers, allowing for upcoming events and acts to be noticed by consumers. Through this, I will have to choose the best medium to grant to most reach to consumers and create the most awareness for their product or event. Whilst doing this, I will also be trying to secure and keep in contact with acts for events, and put venues in touch with these acts. This job is appealing to me, as, like most of my young generation, I love to see live music and performances. However, I have never noticed or been aware of the processes and work behind the scenes of these events, and it is massive interest to me. I also love the feeling of conducting a successful event, and playing a part in creating an enjoyable experience for the crowd that attends. Another major bonus would be the ability to enjoy the event as it is taking part, and celebrating the work of my team and myself behind it. </p>
							<p>As the advertisement states, for this type of role I would need at least 5 years of marketing communications experience, with knowledge in both B2C and B2B marketing. I would need to be able to select the correct advertising medium to gain the most reach to both consumers and other businesses. This would include knowledge on social media, television, radio and email marketing tools and platforms. As I am going to be in contact with clients, a level of social skills would also be required, as well as sales skills. I would need knowledge of current music trends and popular artists; to ensure that I was targeting the correct music acts to create events for. I would need knowledge on how to create successful email and social media marketing campaigns for multiple generations, and create campaigns that efficiently and effectively target desired consumers. </p>
							<p>I currently possess very few of the skills required to apply for this job. I have knowledge on the correct mediums used to target specific generations, but not how to specifically apply them to a correct key audience. I have little knowledge on email marketing, and how to effectively use it, but I do have knowledge on how it works on a basic level. I have very little B2B marketing experience, however most of my knowledge on B2C marketing is of a good standard. I have good social skills, however lack in my sales pitch skills, and how to effectively manipulate someone to feel a need for a specific product or service. I have a passion for the music scene and trends within it, with knowledge ranging within genres such as hip-hop and rap, and electronic music such, specifically techno, drum & bass and trance. I also do not have the required years of experience within the marketing and business field.</p>
							<p>An efficient plan of how to gain these skills would be to start at a lower position within the same company, as either an employee or intern. Through this, I can gain the knowledge and skills of higher ranked employees, whilst simultaneously creating a network to thrive off. If I cannot secure a job or internship within the same field, then an internship somewhere else would be another viable option. Though I will not gain directly usable skills and knowledge for my ideal job, I will still be able to gain other various skills and knowledge within the field and industry that would be useful. It may also be a possibility that skills gained within another industry may be beneficial, as I could provide something new and fresh to the music industry from my previous one. Another key component to my plan would be the completion of my degree, and potentially even a masters degree. Through this constant learning process and social interactions with peers, I am able to increase and strengthen my business network and learn new skills from tutors with multiple years of experiences, who have worked in various industries within the marketing field. </p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<img src="images/img1.png" alt="Learning Styles Test Results">
							<img src="images/img2.png" alt="Myer Briggs Personality Test Results">
							<img src="images/img3.png" alt="Big 5 Personality Test Results">				
							<p>Taking the learning styles test, and then discovering I was an auditory style learner made a lot of sense to me. I definitely can acknowledge that I perform tasks more efficiently when they are explained to me, but however also feel I perform better if they are also shown to me, and then practiced myself. The visual style of learning was ranked as the lowest, which is also understandable. Tasks and information that is presented solely in a visuals-based style is often hard for me to process. After completing the 2 personality tests, I can see some results do not align within both tests. The Myer-Briggs testing stated was more extroverted, however the Big 5 Personality test stated I had low extroversion levels. I would agree more with the latter, as I have higher levels of introversion within unfamiliar surroundings. The Myer-Briggs test labeled me as a ‘Doer’, where I agree with this. I am focused on immediate results, and have a high regard for my peers. </p>
							<p>The extroversion levels within both personality tests dictate how I will interact with my peers within group work. The low extroversion levels state that I will be shy, however I believe if there is a set task this will be almost nullified due to the shared need of completing the set task. As I am an auditory learner, it may mean that I will need to process concepts and ideas of my peers in a different manner. It may also mean that I present content in a different style. My high level of agreeableness will be a positive factor amongst group work. As I am a friendly and optimistic person, it creates a healthy and positive working environment for my peers. It allows them share ideas, concepts and draft work without fear of being negatively criticized. Alternatively, I also believe that if there was conflict, or issues arose amongst team members, that I would be able to resolve it within the group. </p>
							<p>When forming a team, I should not only take into account the results of these tests personally, but also the results of my peers. Choosing personality types that work together is vital in the success and productivity of a group. Choosing peers who have similar results to myself will work to a certain degree, however a range of differing personality types is ideal. This will allow the group the ability to cover and present content to each other in differing ways, potentially solving problems in ways not thought of by a singular personality type. Being an auditory learner, I will need to surround myself with those who are of other learning styles. This grants the opportunity for each member to create unique ways of presenting content, and combine these to cover all bases. </p>

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<p>A key project that I wish to see within the IT field is a cross-platform game, which operates on smartphone devices or tablets, and the two main computer operating systems, being MacOS and Windows. Depending on the success of the product, it may also be then available on console systems such as the Playstation and Xbox. The game will record and save data across all platforms, which can then be resumed on whichever platform is used next. The game feature both offline and online aspects, allowing for players to choose to complete tasks by themselves, or in a group.</p>
							<p>Mobile gaming is a massively growing trend globally, with the industries market value expecting to reach $74.4 billion USD in 2019. This value is a 24.4% increase in market value from 2017, which boasted $59.8 billion USD. There are various games that are multi-platform compatible, however many fail to create a link between the platforms. This game will allow users to complete tasks or missions that are directly transferable between platforms. Their account will be covered over all devices, meaning that saved data is not lost by switching between phone and computer.</p>
							<p>The product will feature two versions of the game, one for mobile operating systems and one for computer operating systems. Both games will follow the same storyline, and have similar goals in terms of progression through the game. </p>
							<p>The main storyline and bulk of the game content will be within the computer-based game. This will be an open-world style game, with the ability to switch between solo (offline play) and multiplayer (online play) modes. The game will feature a level-based progression method, where players will be able to access better items and gear through this progression method. </p>
							<p>Offline play will consist of a main storyline, as well as various side tasks that players can work to complete, gaining rewards for each of these. Online play will consist of various group-oriented tasks, where players must work together to complete these. It will also include an arena-style mode, where players are able to compete against others. </p>
							<p>The data for the game will be either stored on a disc, which will then require players to install and store a fraction of the data on their hard drives, or will be completely stored on the hard drive of the user. This will include game data such as maps, character models, item models and all other essential game data. If there is no online connection, various activities will be blocked for the user until there is one present. </p>
							<p>The phone-based game will feature various side stories and missions that are specifically tailored towards the operating system. From the completion of these missions, the player will be rewarded with content that is either able to be used across both platforms, or redeemable in the main computer game. Offline content will feature various side stories that will be on a random bi-weekly rotation, which in turn will require the game to be constantly updated to access. The bulk of the phone game will require an online connection, with various side-missions and an online Arena-based mode requiring use of the Internet. </p>
							<p>The data for the phone-based version of the game will be stored within cloud server systems, allowing for easy and quick access for users, and less stress on servers for the company. All offline data will have to be stored within the players phone, however this will only be a small fraction of data, with a high pool of rewards randomly given on each successful completion.</p>
							<p>Players will have the ability to play solely the computer-based game, but are heavily encouraged to use both platforms. Content will be made specifically for the phone-based version, and some rewards will be exclusively available to those who complete this content. The game will feature components in the game that will require payment, however this content will be of purely cosmetic value, or as a means to speed up the progression component of the game. All in-game rewards will be accessible to all players provided that they are using both platforms, as providing a so-called ‘pay-to-win’ option may cause players to become disheartened. </p>
							<p>The game will need various types of software to run successfully. Software will need to be compatible across various operating systems (MacOS, iOS and Windows), and data must have the ability to be directly transferable across all of these platforms. Cloud storage must also be present to successfully run the online phone version of the game, which could also be used for the online component of the computer games. If this is not feasible, then regular servers must be established for both online versions of the game. Constant development and coding of new content, as well as a high level of creativity must be present in order to keep players interested and playing. </p>
							<p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be having created a successful, cross-platform online multiplayer game. Depending on the level of success, it can then be reevaluated if the progression of creating console-based versions is a viable option. Another option could be the development of a completely new game, depending on how successful the cross-platform component of the project has been. The original problem of finding a game that users can enjoy everywhere will have been solved, as they can enjoy this experience either at home, or when they are out. The game will also solve the problem of having directly transferable rewards between systems, causing users to feel like they are not wasting their time focusing on either version. This development may have a large impact within the gaming scene, causing other competitors to follow suit and develop linked games that are enjoyable across all platforms.</p>
